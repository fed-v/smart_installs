In this folder you will have all your JS assets. 

Javascript frameworks are stored in the libs folder. They should be bundled up into 
one file since there will be no changes made to them and are maintained 
separately by their vendor.

The main javascript will have the custom script. It will have frequent changes which 
requires a re-build for every change and use common shared dependencies that are 
separate.
